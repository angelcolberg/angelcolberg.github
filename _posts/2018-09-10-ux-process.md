## Summary

This is a quick overview of the current design process, methods, and techniques which I employ in order to assess causal user needs and frustrations using observational and subjective data. I do this so that I can properly identify which features will satisfy the user's goals and add a definitive value proposition to their experience beyond just solving business case or the initial problem definition. 

Having a hypothesis driven design process is especially useful in cases where I need to:

1. make a decision based on observational or subjective data, otherwise known as qualitative data.
2. gather behavioral and attitudinal insights from users' qualitative data.
3. map intent to behavioral cues through user and mental models derived from interviews with users.
4. facilitate design thinking, culture and understanding across the company by modeling the gathered data with the rest of the team.

### Exploratory Phase

#### Data Gathering
Gather requirements, KPIâ€™s, and a wish list of features through stakeholder interviews.  Expose behavioral and attitudinal insights through primary and secondary research methods, which can then be modeled with the rest of the team. Facilitating findings allows the concept model to take shape so that it can then be defined.

### Generative Phase

#### Information Architecture
Define the navigation, taxonomy, terminology, and metadata in order to enhance findability, and searchability.

#### Content Strategy
Content planning, development, and management should take place alongside the IA and IxD phases in collaboration with other teams.

#### Interaction Design
Define the interaction model, flows, and prototypes that can be used to assess usability and user acceptance testing with users.

#### Visual Design
Define the brand, identity, color palette, and typography. Create mockups and deliverables that ensure implementation parity. 

---

### Evaluative Phase

#### Usability Testing
Planning and running heuristic and  evaluations around ease of use, and learnability.

#### User Testing
Attitudinal and behavioral evaluations of hypotheses.

---

## Methods

#### Interviews
Various types of interviews can be conducted for evaluative and/or exploratory purposes.  

#### Card Sorting and Treejacks
Open to gain insights, and closed to evaluate assumptions.

#### Needs Analysis
Needs analysis based on qualitative data gathered in the exploratory research phase.
 
#### Task Analysis
Breaking downs the tasks and then modelling them allows us to simplify flows, minimize redundancy, measure behaviors and ensure cohesiveness.
