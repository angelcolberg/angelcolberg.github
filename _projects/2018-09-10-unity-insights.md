#### Problem 
Analytics needs to provide information as not everyone is equipped with understanding the nuances of metrics gathering and analysis. 

#### Hypothesis
If we provided everything that we could in order to satisfy the user's intent to help them achieve their goal successfully, then we could increase overal DAU and increase our data pool in order to provide better insights across the industry.  

#### Method
Ideation sessions and interviews helped us conceptualize a dashboard with an actionable activity feed where users can view and act on events and AI derived insights.


#### Result and Next Steps
Mockups were used for early cognitive evaluations and angular prototypes were used to assess flows and user acceptance.
