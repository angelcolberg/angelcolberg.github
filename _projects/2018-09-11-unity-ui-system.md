#### Problem 
Each of the 5 services and the desktop client were using disparate UI frameworks which led to a variety of redundant and inconsistent features and components. 

#### Hypothesis
Creating a common UI library would decrease one-off developmeent of common features and result in a more cohesive and consistent experience. 

#### Method
Mockups were used to gather consensus from the team and users.

#### Result and Next Steps
Created a pattern library for use across my Ads and Analytics teams initially which was then adopted across the other services and shared with the desktop client version.
