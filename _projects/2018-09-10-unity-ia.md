#### Problem 
Navigation across the site was confusing users and resulting in a ridiculously low DAU of 10 in our analytics app when an average of ~10k projects were being created daily with analytics turned on. The problem spanned various touchpoints such as navigation, integration and lack of instructional messaaging.   

#### Hypothesis
Performing an IA audit would help us expose path failures, redundancies, information design gaps and other taxonomical issues.  

#### Method
Treejacks and card sorts were conducted on a handful of participants remotely using Optimal Workshop. 

#### Result and Next Steps
Created cross services' and analytics' maps of users' successful and unsuccessful pathfinding to each service and recommendations for the removal of multiple levels and standardizing patterns across the services.

The immediate effect of our IA changes resulted in an increase from 10 DAU to ~6000 DAU until we were able to resolve further integration issues with our experience that was dropping off a substantial portion of our long tail not accustomed to setting up events for data proceessing. This provided us an opportunity to optimize the integration that would ideally garner us at leas a DAU of 90% of projects created daily.
